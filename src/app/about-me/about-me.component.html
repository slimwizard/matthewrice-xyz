      My interests as a technologist include web development and architecture, cloud computing, containerization, distributed architectures, and developing intuitive and unique UI/UX experiences. 
      I also have creative aspirations which drive me to draw, create music, design clothing, among other things.

    <p>As school comes winding to a close in the next few months, I hope to find more time to add some actual content to this site: maybe a blog, some detailed explanations of projects that I've worked on, etc. But, for now, enjoy the minimilist feels.</p>
